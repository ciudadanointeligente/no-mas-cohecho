=================



## Installation

- Install Jekyll: `gem install jekyll`
- [Fork this repository](https://github.com/ciudadanointeligente/quien-te-financia/fork) *Optional*
- Clone it: `git clone https://github.com/ciudadanointeligente/quien-te-financia`
- Run the jekyll server: `jekyll --server`
- If you have problems with baseurl run this: 'jekyll serve --watch'

You should have a server up and running locally at <http://localhost:4000>.

## Customization

Next you'll want to change a few things. Most of them can be changed directly in
[_config.yml](https://github.com/ciudadanointeligente/quien-te-financia/blob/gh-pages/_config.yml). That's
where we'll pull your name, Twitter username, and things like that.

There's a few other places that you'll want to change, too:

- [CNAME](https://github.com/ciudadanointeligente/quien-te-financia/blob/gh-pages/CNAME): If you're using
  this on GitHub Pages with a custom domain name, you'll want to change this
  to be the domain you're going to use. All that should be in here is a
  domain name on the first line and nothing else (like: `example.com`).
- [favicon.ico](https://github.com/ciudadanointeligente/quien-te-financia/blob/gh-pages/favicon.ico): This
  is a smaller version of my gravatar for use as the icon in your browser's
  address bar. You should change it to whatever you'd like.
- [apple-touch-icon.png](https://github.com/ciudadanointeligente/quien-te-financia/blob/gh-pages/apple-touch-icon.png):
  Again, this is my gravatar, and it shows up in iOS and various other apps
  that use this file as an "icon" for your site.

## Deployment

You should deploy with [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com)- it's just
easier.

All you should have to do is rename your repository on GitHub to be
`username.github.com`. Since everything is on the `gh-pages` branch, you
should be able to see your new site at <http://username.github.com>.
